title: Example Grievance Bots
---

This is an example of building a grievance bot. We consider an organization like [CPGRAMS](https://pgportal.gov.in/) that allows Indian citizens to lodge complaints with any department of the government.

# Step 1: Data Indexing Pipeline

## Intial Data

We scrape the following information from the CPGRAMS website:

## Data Augmentation
We have generated an elaborate description for each grievance by using GPT-4, with appropriate system prompt and providing the ministry name, category and subcategories. The generated description is in following format:

| Ministry           | Category                           | Subcategory 1                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Telecommunications | Employee Related / Services Related | Pending any type of Bill/dues for payment | This grievance category pertains to issues related to pending bills or dues for payment in the telecommunications sector, specifically in relation to employees or services. <br>Individuals may file complaints if they have not received bills for their telecommunications services, if there are errors or discrepancies in the billing, if they are facing challenges in making payments for their bills, or if there are delays in the processing of payments resulting in overdue dues. <br> Some common examples of how people may refer to this grievance include:<br>- Unpaid bills for telecommunications services<br>- Overdue payments for phone/internet services<br>- Outstanding dues for mobile network usage<br>- Pending invoices for employee phone plans<br>It is important for the Department/Ministry of Telecommunications to address these grievances promptly in order to ensure smooth operation of services and fair treatment of employees. |





## Schema for Vector DB

We need to make this available in a VectorDB to fetch the data based on similarity. We create the following schema. `embedding` is the vector representation of `description` column.
```
class GrievanceCategory(Base):
    __tablename__ = "grievance_category"
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    ministry = Column(String)
    category = Column(String)
    subcategory = Column(ARRAY(String))
    description = Column(String)
    embedding = mapped_column(Vector(1536))
    fields = Column(ARRAY(JSON))
```

`fields` stores an array of fields that the user needs to provide to lodge their compliant.

```
The user's grievance revolves around an issue with accessing their Permanent Account Number (PAN) card from DigiLocker. DigiLocker is a digital platform launched by the Government of India aimed at ensuring that citizens have access to authentic digital documents in a digital wallet provided by the government. The user's inability to access their PAN card from this platform can be attributed to several potential causes, such as technical glitches within the DigiLocker system, issues related to the linking of the PAN with the user's DigiLocker account, or discrepancies in the user's personal information that may be causing a mismatch.

Key elements to extract and analyze for effectively categorizing and addressing this grievance include:

1. **Nature of the Issue**: The problem is specifically related to accessing a government-issued document (PAN card) through a government-provided digital service (DigiLocker). This indicates that the grievance falls within the domain of digital governance and e-services.

2. **Services Involved**: The grievance involves two critical services - the issuance and management of PAN cards, which is typically overseen by the Income Tax Department, and the DigiLocker service, which is an initiative under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Understanding the interplay between these services is crucial for addressing the grievance.

3. **Possible Causes**: The issue could stem from technical problems (e.g., server downtime, app malfunctions), user account issues (e.g., incorrect login credentials, PAN not linked to DigiLocker), or data mismatches (e.g., discrepancies in personal details between PAN records and DigiLocker).

4. **Information Required for Resolution**: To effectively address the grievance, additional information might be needed, such as error messages received, steps already taken by the user to try and resolve the issue, and confirmation of personal details for verification purposes.

5. **Impact on the User**: The inability to access the PAN card digitally can affect the user's ability to perform various financial transactions and comply with statutory requirements, highlighting the urgency of resolving the issue.

6. **Potential Departments for Escalation**: The grievance may need to be escalated to the Income Tax Department for issues related to PAN details and to the technical team behind DigiLocker for problems related to the digital platform itself.

This detailed analysis helps in understanding the complexity of the issue, which spans across technical, procedural, and personal information verification aspects, requiring a coordinated response from multiple government departments.

    Do not recommend grievance buckets that do not satisfy all the categories and subcatgories according to the information provided by user.
    If you think you do not have enough information, generate a short follow up question that can be asked to the user whose response can help in determining the grievance bucket.
    Also, generate an brief empathetic prefix message to show to the user before asking the followup question.
    Do not recommend grievance buckets if multiple grievance buckets from the list satisfing the criteria given by required information. Ask the user to provide more information.
    The follow up question should be very diverse.
