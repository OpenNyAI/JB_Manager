title: Quickstart
---

This quickstart is designed for linux based systems such as Linux distros and Mac. 
If using windows, Use WSL terminal to follow the quickstart. For installation instruction, refer to [WSL Installation Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 

## Prerequisite 
1. **Docker** - Ensure that your system has docker engine installed and running. For installation, please refer to [docker engine installation instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). 
    * The recommended way is to install docker desktop for your system. 
    If using WSL with Windows, Enable docker for you WSL distro. Please refer to [docker desktop installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers#install-docker-desktop) for more details.
2. **Docker Compose** - Ensure docker compose is enabled along with docker engine. Please refer to [docker compose installation instruction](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. **Loophole** - Loophole is required to expose your local system to the services on web by tunneling the external calls to your local system. Please refer to [Loophole Quickstart Guide](https://loophole.cloud/download/) for installation.
5. **Translation and Speech API** - JBManager uses speech processing API to handle audio and translation API to handle user input in various languages. Please refer to Translation and Speech API [setup guide](../references/speech-and-translation.md) for more details.
6. **Whatsapp Interface** - This quickstart will focus on setup your own through whatsapp as channel. Please refer to [channel setup guide](../references/whatsapp.md) for more details.

## Running JB Manager
1. Clone and Change the directory to the project root.
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:OpenNyAI/Jugalbandi-Manager.git
$ cd Jugalbandi-Manager
```
2. Copy the contents of `.env-dev.template` file to `.env-dev` in the same directory.
```bash
$ cp .env-dev.template .env-dev
```
3. Update the values of translation and speech fields in the `.env-dev` file.
```
# Bhasini Keys
BHASHINI_USER_ID=
BHASHINI_API_KEY=
BHASHINI_PIPELINE_ID=
# Azure Speech Keys
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=
# Azure Translation Keys
AZURE_TRANSLATION_KEY=
AZURE_TRANSLATION_RESOURCE_LOCATION=
# Whatsapp API URL
WA_API_HOST=
```
4. Generate an Encryption key using the following command 
```bash
$ dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | openssl base64
``` 
and add it to `ENCRYPTION_KEY` in `.env-dev` file. 
```
# Encryption key for storing credentials
ENCRYPTION_KEY=
```
Note: Remember to enclose value of `ENCRYPTION_KEY` within single quotes.

5. Create a folder `media` in the project root, and start a http server on port 5000 inside the `media` directory.
```bash
$ mkdir -p media
$ cd media
$ python3 -m http.server 5000
```

6. Start a new shell session and start loophole tunnel for port 5000 on your system
```bash
$ ./loophole http 5000
```
Copy the tunnel url from the loophole shell and add it to `PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX` in `.env-dev` file.

```
PUBLIC_URL_PREFIX= # Set Tunnel URL if using local storage
```

7.  Start JB Manager
```bash
$ bash scripts/run.sh --stage api channel language flow frontend
```
8. Once the services are up and running, you can access the JB Manager UI at [http://localhost:4173](http://localhost:4173).

## Bot Installation and Go Live

1. Go to [JB Manager UI](http://localhost:4173) 
![](../assets/quickstart-frontend.png)
2. Click on install new bot and provide the required data to create your bot. ![](../assets/quickstart-botdetails.png)
The detailed information about the fields are given below:
    1. **Name [Mandatory]** is the name of the bot. It should be the name of class for your bot code mentioned below. For this example, use `CarWashDealerFSM`.
    2. **Code [Mandatory]** is the fsm.py file python code. Copy the contents of [python file](car_wash.py) and paste it.
    3. **version [Mandatory]** - version of the bot. Put `1.0.0`.
    4. **required_credentials [Mandatory]** - Credentials required by the bot to access various external services. Enter the following: `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY,AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION,AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT,FAST_MODEL,SLOW_MODEL` , so put these keys in this section seperated by comma.
    5. Click on `Install` button.
    
3. Once the bot is created, click on the **settings (⚙) icon** to enter the given credentials values and click save to save the credentials values. For this example, put the values of `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT`, `FAST_MODEL` (typically, `gpt-3.5-turbo`) and `SLOW_MODEL` (typically, `gpt-4`). **Note: Remember to verify your model names. If you are using Azure OpenAI, this corresponds to Deployment Name and not model type**

4. Then click on the **play (▶️) icon** to activate the bot by providing the whatsapp business phone number in `phone number` and whatsapp api key in the `whatsapp` field. 
![](../assets/quickstart-botactivate.png)
5. Once the above steps are completed, the bot status will be changed from **inactive** to **active**.

6. Start a new shell session and start loophole tunnel for port 8000 on your system
```bash
$ ./loophole http 8000
```
7. Copy the tunnel url from the loophole shell.
![](../assets/quickstart-loophole-8000.png)
8. Add this url to register the callback URL for Whatsapp service provider. Your callback url will look like this `<Tunnel URL>/callback`. 

    For this tutorial, we are using the shell script to add the callback URL. Run the script on a new shell session with the appropriate values to register the callback URL.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    WEBHOOK_URL="<Webhook url here>"
    WA_API_HOST="<API host here>"
    WABA_NUMBER="<Whatsapp business account number>"
    WA_API_KEY="<API Key here>"

    BODY='{"webhook_url": "'$WEBHOOK_URL'"}'
    echo $BODY
    curl -k "$WA_API_HOST/v1/setwebhooks" \
    --header "wanumber: $WABA_NUMBER" \
    --header "apikey: $WA_API_KEY" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw "$BODY"
    ```
9. Your bot is running. Send a `Hi` message to whatsapp business number to start conversation with the bot.
